### Sundouleia is made by players, for players. It is not designed with short-sighted vision, but with thoughtfulness toward its long-term impact. Its purpose is to preserve the health of the greater whole.

Following the events that transpired after the Mare shutdown, it is important to remember that whenever major platforms fall, opportunists rush to fill in the gap. These people take advantage of those in fear, panic, and desperation to be loud, make quick solutions, and a quick rush to fame.

But as Floof/DarkArchon & Ottermandias reminded us—those who rush to fill these gaps are inherently untrustworthy. That we need time to let the dust settle, and give time for a solutions to arrive that is not made with a short sighted vision, and crafted with consideration.

Sundouleia’s development team has worked with Mares tech stack for the past two years. We understand its structure, its strengths, and its limitations inside and out. But when Mare fell, we made a conscious decision not to act immediately.

We believed the community needed time. Time to process what was lost, to reflect on why it mattered, and to recognize the value of what had been taken for granted. We chose patience over speed, and respect over reaction. True safety, trust, and long-term stability cannot be rushed, but come to those who wait.

At the end of the day, we’re all in the same boat. Placing too much trust in someone who doesn’t consider the broader impact of their actions puts everyone at risk. One misstep, whether it is a tool that goes too far, too public, repeats past mistakes, or becomes unstoppable, invites harsher action from SE. This is not just about features or syncing. It is about protecting the foundation that keeps our boat afloat.

This is what drives Sundouleia. To create a plugin that has longevity, security, safety, and consideration for the future ahead, so people can continue using something they enjoy without living in fear that they will wake up tomorrow and have it no longer there.

Sundouleia focuses on taking what everyone used in Mare, while discarding / revising the additions its creator came to regret. Our solution is built for the long haul, created with its own codebase, custom UI, authentication, player management, and secure file sharing. Designed for scalability, stability, and respect for the community.

#### We wish to prove that:
- Trust can be earned without being loud or vocal.
- People can come together and work toward a better future without ulterior motives.
- A good next solution does not need to stem from ego, greed, or some race.

We need to work together and make something for everyone, while also respecting the generous boundaries yoship has set for us to have without overstepping them. We do not need to fuel it through greed and money.
